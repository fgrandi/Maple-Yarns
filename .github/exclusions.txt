# This file lists items that might be considered for exclusion from different processes (e.g., Git tracking, site builds).
# Note: This file itself is not automatically processed by standard tools like Git or Jekyll.
# - For Git exclusions, use a .gitignore file at the project root.
# - For GitHub Pages (Jekyll) build exclusions, add to the 'exclude' list in _config.yml.

# Potential files/patterns for exclusion:

# Backup files
*.backup
styles/main.css.backup

# Test/temporary files
test.css

# Project metadata / documentation (if not part of the live site content)
README.md
package.json
_config.yml

# Directories often excluded
# node_modules/
# .sass-cache/
# .vscode/

# OS-specific files
.DS_Store

# The .github directory itself is often excluded from site builds
# (though this file is inside it)
